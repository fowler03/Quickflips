        <h2 class="Heading2">Hospice Item Set (HIS)</h2>
        <p>The Hospice Item Set (HIS) has been initiated by CMS to gather data on the use of best practices in assessments and the initiation of specific interventions in hospice.&#160; This data will be obtained by each hospice by pulling information from all admission and discharge documentation.&#160; The HIS has specific questions to provide data on seven (7) quality measures.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The HIS is not an assessment tool, but it is important for clinicians to understand how their documentation will be used in quality reporting.&#160; The measures selected have already been approved by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and are intended to show that a specific hospice “Does the right things, right.”</p>

        <p>As a part of the team caring for the hospice patient, your assessment always determines the POC.&#160; Your assessments and discussions put patient interventions into motion.&#160; The documentation of assessments, discussions and your interventions must be complete in order to provide accurate data for the HIS.&#160; Be sure to take credit by providing thorough and timely documentation.</p>
