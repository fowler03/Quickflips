        <p>The patient may continue to see the attending physician for care related to the hospice diagnosis.&#160; The attending physician bills Medicare Part B for those visits. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Any other doctor the patient sees for care related to the hospice diagnosis cannot bill Medicare Part B; if he/she does, the bills will be denied.&#160; If the patient wants to see another doctor for care related to the hospice diagnosis, the hospice has to approve it and pay the doctor directly.  </p>
