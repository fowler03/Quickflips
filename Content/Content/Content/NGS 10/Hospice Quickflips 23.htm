        <p>It is important that you help the patient accurately identify who his/her attending will be <span class="span_1">at the time the patient elects hospice</span>.&#160; One of the hospice patient’s rights is to choose his or her attending physician.&#160; The patient’s choice of attending physician should be documented.&#160; The referring physician is not necessarily the attending physician.&#160; The physician who signs the initial certification of terminal illness should be the attending physician.&#160; Having one doctor sign the COTI and another doctor listed as attending is incorrect. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to explaining the role of attending physician to the patient/family, there are questions you can ask to determine who the attending will be.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Questions to ask the patient (or his/her representative) in order to get this information:</li>
            <li class="li_7">Who is your “regular” doctor?</li>
            <li class="li_7">Which doctor would you like to visit regularly, now that you are a hospice patient?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Questions to ask the referring physician:</li>
            <li class="li_7">Will Dr. Referent sign the Plan of Care and continue to follow this patient?</li>
            <li class="li_7">Would Dr. Referent like to see this patient after admission to hospice?</li>
            <li class="li_7">Is Dr. Referent this patient’s primary care physician?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <p>The patient may continue to see the attending physician for care related to the hospice diagnosis.&#160; The attending physician bills Medicare Part B for those visits. </p>
        <p>Any other doctor the patient sees for care related to the hospice diagnosis cannot bill Medicare Part B; if he/she does, the bills will be denied.&#160; If the patient wants to see another doctor for care related to the hospice diagnosis, the hospice has to approve it and pay the doctor directly. </p>
