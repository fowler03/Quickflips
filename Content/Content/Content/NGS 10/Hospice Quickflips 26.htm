        <p>Evaluating and documenting eligibility for hospice care requires that you incorporate the eligibility guidelines into your thinking, team process and documentation.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> <MadCap:toggler targets="Culture of Eligibility List">Here are some ideas for creating a “culture of eligibility.”
</MadCap:toggler></p>
        <ul MadCap:targetName="Culture of Eligibility List">
            <li class="li_1">Be sure you have a current copy of the LCD guidelines.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Refer to the guidelines before each visit, and before you write your assessments and visit notes.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Make available a copy to the IDT, and review one with your team at the beginning of every meeting, (“LCD of the Week”).</li>
            <li class="li_1">Use LCD-specific worksheets when documenting admissions and recertifications.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Review the LCD guidelines for every admission and recertification before it is presented in IDT meeting.</li>
            <li class="li_1">In IDT meeting, rather than discuss patients by alphabet or by nurse, group them according to diagnosis, reviewing the LCD guideline before each group.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Hang poster-size copies of the guidelines in your IDT room.&#160; Reference them.&#160; Quiz each other on them.&#160; Refer to them when reviewing patients.</li>
        </ul>
