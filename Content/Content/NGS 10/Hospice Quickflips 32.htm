        <h2 class="Heading2">Continuous Care</h2>
        <p class="p_1">Nursing care may be covered on a continuous basis for as much as 24 hours a day during periods of crisis as necessary to maintain the patient at home.&#160; A period of crisis is a period in which the patient requires <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">A dying patient is <span class="span_1">not</span> a crisis, unless the symptoms are so severe that without <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> the patient will need to be hospitalized.</li>
            <li class="li_1">It may be useful to think of the <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> criteria as being the same as inpatient criteria, except the goal is to prevent hospital admission.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Patients and families must understand that once the crisis is resolved and the patient is stabilized, <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> will be discontinued.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><span class="span_1">Continuous care</span> is meant to be for very brief periods of time, generally just a few days. </li>
            <li class="li_1">When <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> is in place, it must be documented that the entire team is working with the patient and family to manage effectively without <span class="span_1">continuous care</span><span class="span_4">.</span></li>
            <li class="li_1">The documentation for starting and maintaining <span class="span_1">continuous care</span> must reflect the crisis.&#160; The Plan of Care and notes must say, “<span class="span_1">Continuous care</span> required due to___________, as evidenced by_________________.”&#160; “Dying process” or “end-of-life care” is not acceptable, without specifying the distressing symptoms that require constant care and/or monitoring.</li>
            <li class="li_1">HAs, RNs and LPNs can be providers of <span class="span_1">continuous care</span>, but an RN or LPN must provide at least 51% of the care in order to bill for at this level of care.</li>
            <li class="li_1">A minimum of 8 hours of care must be furnished to qualify for continuous care.&#160; However, the continuous care hours can be split into different shifts.&#160; Continuous care is billed on an hourly basis.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Documentation should be hourly and describe:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_13">Ongoing symptoms</li>
            <li class="li_13">Symptom management</li>
            <li class="li_18">Effectiveness of interventions</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><span class="span_1">Continuous care</span> is <span class="span_1">not</span>:</h4>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_1">For every dying patient</li>
            <li class="li_1">Respite care</li>
            <li class="li_1">An alternative to a nursing home</li>
            <li class="li_1">An alternative to private duty care for a patient who cannot be left alone</li>
        </ul>
