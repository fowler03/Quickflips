        <p>Both 1 and 2 below should be present.&#160; Factors from 3 help support the prognosis. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Severe chronic lung disease as documented by both a and b: </li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 43pt;" start="1">
            <li>Disabling dyspnea at rest, poor or unresponsive to bronchodilators, resulting in decreased functional capacity (e.g., bed-to-chair existence, fatigue, and cough.) </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Documentation of FEV1, after bronchodilator, less than 30% of predicted is objective evidence for disabling dyspnea, but is not required.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 43pt;" start="2">
            <li>Progression of end stage pulmonary disease, as evidenced by increasing ER visits or hospitalizations for pulmonary infections and/or respiratory failure or increased physician home visits prior to initial certification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Documentation of serial decrease of FEV1&gt;40ml a year is objective evidence of disease progression, but is not required.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="2">
            <li>Hypoxemia at rest on room air, as evidenced by pO2≤55mmHg; or <span class="Hyperlink">O</span><span class="Hyperlink">2 </span><span class="Hyperlink">saturation≤88%</span>, determined either by arterial blood gases or oxygen saturation monitors or hypercapnia as evidenced by pCO2≥50mmHg. This information may be obtained from recent (within 3 months) hospital records.</li>
            <li>The following factors also lend support to a terminal diagnosis of pulmonary disease.&#160; Document them if they are present.</li>
