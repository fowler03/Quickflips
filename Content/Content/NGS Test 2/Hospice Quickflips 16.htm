        <h2 class="Heading2">Assessment and Care Planning</h2>
        <p>The comprehensive assessment and Plan of Care (POC) are mirrors of each other.&#160; The POC must be individualized, based on the initial and ongoing comprehensive assessment of the patient.&#160; Assessment and care planning are ongoing, continuous processes updated by the interdisciplinary team (IDT), as the patient’s needs and condition changes.&#160; Use the following lists to ensure that your assessment and POC are complete.</p>
        <p>Assessment should include: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">

        </ul>
        <p>Plan of Care should include: </p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Hospice Item Set (HIS) and Impact on Assessment and Care Planning</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Beginning July 2014, CMS mandated that hospices report quality data utilizing the Hospice Item Set (HIS) as the data collection tool</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Seven (7) quality measures&#160; chosen by CMS are seen as “best practices” which are a reflection of the level of quality care provided</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">HIS data will be pulled from the IDT’s assessments and interventions in the POC</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Timeliness in the completion of assessment and POC is essential to meet the CMS mandated timeframes (See Quickflip #19 for Hospice Dates and Times)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">See Quickflip #16a for Hospice Item Set</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Follow these steps for a dynamic, continuous assessment and care planning process.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Patients are assessed by each discipline.&#160; Problems, goals and interventions are identified (based on the patient’s/family’s needs and goals).&#160; This group of individualized problems/goals/interventions is collectively called the Plan of Care (POC).</li>
            <li>Based on the POC, each discipline provides care/service to the patient/family.&#160; That means that each visit should be focused on a problem identified on the POC, and reflect professional intervention(s) to achieve the desired goal.</li>
            <li>Document the patient’s progress toward meeting the desired goal(s) in the POC after each visit.&#160; The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) summarizes the effectiveness of interventions and plans for the next two weeks on the IDT summary form.&#160; Every visit note and IDT note should reflect attention to the problems/goals/interventions.</li>
            <li>If you are seeing a patient, and the focus of the visit is not on one of the problems identified in the POC, ask “Am I focused on a new problem?”&#160; If so, add it to the POC!&#160; If you are not focused on a new or existing problem, ask “Is there a need for me to visit?”</li>
            <li>If you are seeing a patient and none of the problems on the POC requires you or the patient’s attention, ask yourself, “Are these problems resolved?”&#160; If so, document the resolution.</li>
            <li>If there are consistently no problems that you and the patient/family can work to resolve together, ask yourself “Am I seeing this patient too frequently?&#160; Does this patient require intervention from my discipline at this time?”&#160; If you are a case manager, ask “Is this patient still eligible for hospice care?”</li>
            <li>Adjust visit frequencies for the upcoming two weeks based on patient/family needs and goals.</li>
