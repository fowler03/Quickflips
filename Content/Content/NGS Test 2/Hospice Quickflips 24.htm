        <h2 class="Heading2">Consulting Physicians</h2>
        <p>A hospice may arrange for another individual or entity to furnish services to its hospice patients.&#160; The hospice must have a legally binding written agreement for the provision of arranged services.</p>
        <p>If the team decides a consultation is needed, ask your supervisor if an agreement or contract is in place for that physician.&#160; </p>
        <p>You must document:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">That the decision to refer was discussed by the IDT </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">That the reason for referring is related to the hospice diagnosis and part of the Plan of Care (POC)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The results/outcome of the consulting physician visit, as shared by the consulting physician</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The hospice pays the consulting physician, and then bills Medicare for reimbursement for professional services.&#160; Any procedures performed (and included in the POC by the team) come out of the hospice daily rate.</p>
        <p>This only applies if the consultation is related to the hospice diagnosis.&#160; </p>
        <p>If the patient wishes to see a doctor for a problem that is not related to the hospice diagnosis, he /she can see any doctor he/she wishes, and that doctor bills Medicare directly.</p>
