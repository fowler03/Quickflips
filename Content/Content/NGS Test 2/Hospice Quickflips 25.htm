        <h2 class="Heading2">IDT Meeting “Do’s and Don’ts”</h2>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Please DO!</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Come to IDT meeting knowing the care plan for all your patients, the patient’s response to the care plan interventions and whether any interventions need to be changed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Talk to your teammates! Leave voicemail messages, e-mail, and read each other’s progress notes between IDT meetings.&#160; Document that you communicated with them!&#160; The meeting is not meant to take the place of interdisciplinary communication.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Gently redirect your colleagues if they go off on tangents during the meeting.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use staff support and other “together” times to share your triumphs, tears and challenges.&#160; That way you won’t feel “cut off” when redirected during IDT meeting.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Be concise and stick to the agreed upon presentation format when reporting on patients.&#160; This leaves time for in-depth discussion of patients who require it.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document “Well managed with current interventions” or “Well managed with the current Plan of Care” instead of “No change.”&#160; This simply means that the patient is being comfortably maintained due to your interventions.&#160; All your efforts and professional interventions are documented in your progress/visit notes.&#160; Document that patient comfort is being maintained successfully with the current clinical regimen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Come to IDT meeting without knowing which problems you are working on with your patients.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Tell the story of your last visit.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Save all your communication for the IDT meeting.&#160; It’s just one meeting, and it’s not intended to be a substitute for regular interdisciplinary communication and collaboration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Don’t present a snapshot of the patient’s current condition without comparison to their prior status</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suggested format: “The patient is an X year old man/woman with Y diagnosis who has declined in the past benefit period as evidenced by the following...”</li>
