        <p>Suggested format for presenting a new admission at the IDT meeting:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Begin every presentation with “This is an X year old man/woman with the hospice diagnosis of Y...”</li>
            <li>Name, age, gender, diagnosis and attending physician</li>
            <li>Brief history of terminal illness and comorbidities</li>
            <li>Why now?&#160; What precipitated the referral to hospice?</li>
            <li>Problems, goals (including patient/family goals) and interventions identified at admission</li>
            <li>Disciplines and visit frequencies</li>
            <li>Any changes or additions to the Plan of Care since admission?</li>
            <li>Any unresolved issues, clinical or social, that need to be discussed by the team?</li>
            <li>Identify any missing information and assign a team member to obtain it</li>
            <li>Plan for next two weeks (until next IDT meeting or designated interval)</li>
            <li>Document the discussion and the plan (Plan of Care)</li>
        </ol>
