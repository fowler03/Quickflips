        <h2 class="Heading2">Recertification</h2>
        <p>Assessment of eligibility should be continuous.&#160; The recertification evaluation should intensify at least two weeks before the actual recert date to allow time for close monitoring and assessment of the patient’s condition.&#160; Remember, ineligible patients should be discharged as soon as the team determines that they are ineligible; you should not wait until recert time.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Review the LCDs for the patient’s terminal diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Present a review of the patient’s disease progression since the last certification.&#160; Make comparisons to baseline data and data from previous points in time, to accurately demonstrate disease progression.</li>
            <li>Discuss symptomology in terms of the LCD.&#160; Does this patient have a life expectancy of six months or less?&#160; In addition to meeting the LCD criteria, patients should also have evidence of disease progression/decline in condition during the certification period.</li>
            <li>Document the discussion, the supporting evidence and the decision.</li>
            <li>If the team decides to recert:&#160; What is the plan moving forward?&#160; Are problems, goals and interventions appropriate for all disciplines? </li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 43pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Update the Plan of Care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain a recertification of terminal illness.&#160; The hospice medical director must include a brief narrative explanation of the clinical findings that supports a life expectancy of six months or less as part of the recertification.&#160; If the recertification is for the third benefit period or subsequent periods, a face-to-face encounter with the hospice physician or nurse practitioner is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="6">
            <li>If the patient is deemed no longer eligible, begin discharge planning and implement the two-day advance notification of the patient and family and advise them of their right to an expedited review of the hospice’s decision to discharge.</li>
        </ol>
