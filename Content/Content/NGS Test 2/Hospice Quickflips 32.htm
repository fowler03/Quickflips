        <h2 class="Heading2">Continuous Care</h2>
        <p>Nursing care may be covered on a continuous basis for as much as 24 hours a day during periods of crisis as necessary to maintain the patient at home.&#160; A period of crisis is a period in which the patient requires continuous care to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A dying patient is not a crisis, unless the symptoms are so severe that without continuous care the patient will need to be hospitalized.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">It may be useful to think of the continuous care criteria as being the same as inpatient criteria, except the goal is to prevent hospital admission.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Patients and families must understand that once the crisis is resolved and the patient is stabilized, continuous care will be discontinued.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Continuous care is meant to be for very brief periods of time, generally just a few days. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When continuous care is in place, it must be documented that the entire team is working with the patient and family to manage effectively without continuous care.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The documentation for starting and maintaining continuous care must reflect the crisis.&#160; The Plan of Care and notes must say, “Continuous care required due to___________, as evidenced by_________________.”&#160; “Dying process” or “end-of-life care” is not acceptable, without specifying the distressing symptoms that require constant care and/or monitoring.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">HAs, RNs and LPNs can be providers of continuous care, but an RN or LPN must provide at least 51% of the care in order to bill for at this level of care.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A minimum of 8 hours of care must be furnished to qualify for continuous care.&#160; However, the continuous care hours can be split into different shifts.&#160; Continuous care is billed on an hourly basis.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation should be hourly and describe:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 43pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Ongoing symptoms</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Symptom management</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Effectiveness of interventions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Continuous care is not:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For every dying patient</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Respite care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">An alternative to a nursing home</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">An alternative to private duty care for a patient who cannot be left alone</li>
        </ul>
