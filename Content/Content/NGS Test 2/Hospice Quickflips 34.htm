        <h2 class="Heading2">GIP Due to Psychosocial Crisis</h2>
        <p>In April&#160; 2007, CMS issued a transmittal (1539) that clarified that GIP can not be used for caregiver breakdown, stating:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>…some hospices are billing Medicare for “caregiver breakdown” at the higher “general inpatient” level, rather than the lower payment for “inpatient respite” or “routine home care” levels of care. To receive payment for “general inpatient care” under the Medicare hospice benefit, beneficiaries must require an intensity of care directed towards pain control and symptom management that cannot be managed in any other setting.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This means that GIP must be related to symptoms as outlined above. Psychosocial crisis of the caregiver may result in use of respite care. </p>
