        <h2 class="Heading2">Respite Care</h2>
        <p>Respite care is short-term inpatient care provided to a patient to relieve the family members or other persons caring for the individual at home.&#160; Respite care may be provided only on an occasional basis and may not be reimbursed for more than five (5) consecutive days at a time.&#160; It’s alright for caregivers to take a trip, have an elective surgery or do anything they wish with their five days “off.”&#160; Respite care can also be used in cases of caregiver breakdown, as clarified by CMS in April 2007.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document respite care as a measure taken to provide a break for the caregivers.&#160; Hopefully the break will allow them to continue caring for the patient at home.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If due to caregiver breakdown, document the events leading to the respite care being provided.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Don’t forget to document your collaborative care planning and communication with facility staff.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Respite care may not be reimbursed for more than five (5) consecutive days at a time, including the date of admission but NOT including the date of discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the patient dies under inpatient respite care, the day of death is paid at the inpatient respite care rate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Inpatient respite care can only be provided in the following facilities:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 108pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">A Medicare-certified inpatient hospice facility</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">A contracted Medicare-certified hospital or skilled nursing facility that has the capability to provide 24-hour nursing if the patient’s POC requires that type of nursing intervention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note:&#160; Respite care cannot be provided for patients who reside in an assisted living facility or nursing home. </p>
