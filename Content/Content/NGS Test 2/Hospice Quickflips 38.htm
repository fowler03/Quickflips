        <h2 class="Heading2">SOAP Documentation</h2>
        <p>The acronym “SOAP” has been used for decades by health care professionals to help them remember the components of an excellent progress note.&#160; “S” = subjective:&#160; what the patient or family says they are experiencing.&#160; “O” = objective:&#160; the facts and data available.&#160; “A” = assessment:&#160; your professional evaluation.&#160; “P” = plan:&#160; the next best clinical intervention or step.&#160; </p>
        <p>The following examples may help you get the idea.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">S:&#160; Subjective</h4>
