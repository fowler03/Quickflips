        <h2 class="Heading2">The Big Questions</h2>
        <p>Answering these open-ended questions helps your notes provide depth and detail:</p>
        <p>WHY NOW?&#160; Anything new, such as an admission, a change in level of care, or a discharge, should identify a precipitant.&#160; What has changed? </p>
        <p>WHO SAYS?&#160; Is there supporting documentation from recent hospitalizations, attending physician notes, history and physicals, discharge summaries and labs?&#160; Get copies and include them.</p>
        <p>WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?&#160; Whatever it is, make sure there are problems, goals and interventions on the Plan of Care to address the change.</p>
        <p>HOW DO YOU KNOW?&#160; Describe what you see, read, hear, and smell that leads you to use the words you do.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For GIP patients, there are more questions that your notes must answer:</p>
        <p>WHY HERE?&#160; Your notes must describe symptoms and interventions that cannot be provided in another setting. That means, SNF, ALF or at home.</p>
        <p>WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR?  Document what has been tried so far to maintain the patient safely at home.</p>
