        <p>Disclaimer:&#160; The Palmetto LCD coverage criteria are non-specific.&#160; The information below is provided as a guideline to support the prognosis of six months or less and will lend supporting documentation to help define coverage.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This LCD presents a framework for identifying, documenting, and communication the unique health care needs of individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>ESRD may support a diagnosis of six months or less under many different clinical scenarios.&#160; The structural and functional impairments associated with a primary diagnosis of ESRD are often complicated by comorbid and/or secondary conditions. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Renal Failure 1">The basis for palliative interventions and care-planning is your documentation of the following items:</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="1" MadCap:targetName="Renal Failure 1">
            <li>Identification of specific structural/functional impairments</li>
            <li>Relevant activity limitations</li>
            <li>Use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to identify and document service needs of individuals with ESRD is suggested, but not required.&#160; <MadCap:toggler targets="Renal Failure 2">The following are some components that may be addressed in your documentation (list and examples not all inclusive):</MadCap:toggler></li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 90pt;" start="1" MadCap:targetName="Renal Failure 2">
            <li>Structures of the nervous system</li>
            <li>Structures of the cardiovascular and respiratory system e.g. uremic pericarditis, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease</li>
            <li>Structure related to the digestive, metabolic and endocrine systems such as structure of stomach due to PEG tube</li>
            <li>Structure related to genitourinary and reproductive system such as structure of kidneys due to nephrosclerosis</li>
            <li>Mental&#160; function such as state of consciousness, orientation</li>
            <li>Functions of the cardiovascular, hematological, immunological and respiratory system, e.g. sepsis, immunosuppression/AIDS, albumin &lt;3.5 gm/dl, cachexia, platelet count&lt; 25,000, disseminated intravascular coagulation</li>
            <li>Functions of the digestive, metabolic and endocrine systems e.g. GI bleed, secondary hyperparathyroidism, anorexia, swallowing problems, regurgitation and vomiting as evidence by aspiration pneumonia</li>
            <li>Genitourinary and reproductive functions such as urinary excretory functions as evidenced by abnormal creatinine clearance and/or serum creatinine, intractable hyperkalemia</li>
            <li>Neuromusculoskeletal and movement related functions</li>
            <li>Mobility such as changing basic body position, walking</li>
            <li>Self Care, e.g. washing oneself, toileting, dressing</li>
            <li>Environmental factors such as assistive devices&#160; used,&#160; family support, decision not to seek dialysis or renal transplant</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The care plan may be impacted by secondary and comorbid conditions.&#160; The clinician will need to identify and document relevant secondary and comorbid conditions, together with the above mentioned items to help establish hospice eligibility and to maintain a beneficiary-centered plan of care.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Secondary and Comorbid Conditions – The significance of a given comorbid condition is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments, together with any limitation in activity, related to the comorbid condition.&#160; For example, a beneficiary with ESRD and clinically significant CHD would have specific impairments of cardiovascular structure/function (e.g., narrowing of coronary arteries, dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain) which may or may not respond/be amenable to treatment.&#160; The identified impairments in cardiovascular structure/function may be associated with activity limitations (e.g., mobility, self-care).&#160; Ultimately, the combined effects of the ESRD and any comorbid condition should be such that most beneficiaries with ESRD and similar impairments would have a prognosis of six months or less.</p>
