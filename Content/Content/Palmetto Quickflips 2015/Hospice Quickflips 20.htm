        <p>The attending physician is identified by the patient upon admission as having the most significant role in the determination and delivery of his/her medical care.&#160; <MadCap:toggler targets="Attending Physician 1">The attending physician:</MadCap:toggler></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Attending Physician 1">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consents to hospice care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Certifies the patient’s terminal prognosis</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Signs subsequent medical orders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important that you help the patient accurately identify who his/her attending will be at the time the patient elects hospice.&#160; One of the hospice patient’s rights is to choose his or her attending physician.&#160; The patient’s choice of attending physician should be documented.&#160; The referring physician is not necessarily the attending physician.&#160; The physician who signs the initial certification of terminal illness should be the attending physician.&#160; Having one doctor sign the COTI and another doctor listed as attending is incorrect. </p>

            <MadCap:toggler targets="Attending Physician 2;Attending Physician 4">In addition to explaining the role of attending physician to the patient/family, there are questions you can ask to determine who the attending will be.</MadCap:toggler>

        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The patient may continue to see the attending physician for care related to the hospice diagnosis.&#160; The attending physician bills Medicare Part B for those visits. </p>
        <p>Any other doctor the patient sees for care related to the hospice diagnosis cannot bill Medicare Part B; if he/she does, the bills will be denied.&#160; If the patient wants to see another doctor for care related to the hospice diagnosis, the hospice has to approve it and pay the doctor directly. </p>
