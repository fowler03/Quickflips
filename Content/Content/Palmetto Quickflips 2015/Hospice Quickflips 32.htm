        <p>Respite care is short-term inpatient care provided to a patient to relieve the family members or other persons caring for the individual at home.&#160; Respite care may be provided only on an occasional basis and may not be reimbursed for more than five (5) consecutive days at a time.&#160; It’s alright for caregivers to take a trip, have an elective surgery or do anything they wish with their five days “off.”&#160; <MadCap:toggler targets="Respite Care 1">Respite care can also be used in cases of caregiver breakdown, as clarified by CMS in April 2007.</MadCap:toggler></p>
