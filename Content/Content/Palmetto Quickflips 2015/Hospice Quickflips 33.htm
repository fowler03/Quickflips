        <p>An increasing number of patients residing in nursing homes* are benefiting from hospice care.</p>
        <p>A member of the interdisciplinary team will be designated for a patient residing in the facility to provide overall coordination of hospice care and communication with facility staff.&#160; This helps ensure quality of care for the patient and family.&#160; </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Hospice Care in a Nursing Home">In addition to the documentation requirements and regulations for routine home care patients, the clinicians need to document that the following was delivered to the facility:</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Hospice Care in a Nursing Home">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Most recent Plan of Care</li>

        <p>This type of documentation demonstrates that the hospice is maintaining professional case management of the patient’s care, communicating and collaborating with the nursing home.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Documentation of shared care planning (attendance at care planning meetings in the facility, sharing the results of hospice IDT meetings, joint family meetings) also demonstrates collaboration.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Any changes in the hospice plan of care must be discussed with the patient/representative and facility representatives and must be approved by the hospice before implementation.</p>
