        <p>This LCD presents a framework for identifying, documenting, and communicating the unique health care needs of individuals with cardiopulmonary (CP) conditions.</p>
        <p>Cardiopulmonary (CP) conditions are associated with impairments, activity limitations, and disability.&#160; Their impact depends on the individual’s over-all health status.&#160; CP conditions may support a prognosis of six months or less under many clinical scenarios.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Cardiopulmonary Conditions 1">The basis for palliative interventions and care-planning is your documentation of the items below:</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1" MadCap:targetName="Cardiopulmonary Conditions 1">
            <li>Identification of specific structural/functional impairments</li>
            <li>Relevant activity limitations</li>
            <li>Use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to identify and document service needs of individuals with CP conditions is suggested, but not required.&#160; (See ICF Worksheet.)&#160; <MadCap:toggler targets="Cardiopulmonary Conditions 2">The following are components that need to be addressed in your documentation:</MadCap:toggler></li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1" MadCap:targetName="Cardiopulmonary Conditions 2">
            <li>Appetite</li>
            <li>Sleep functions such as amount and quality of sleep</li>
            <li>Pain in the chest</li>
            <li>Heart functions such as heart rhythm, contraction force of ventricular muscles and blood supply to the heart</li>
            <li>General physical endurance</li>
            <li>Sensations related to the disease such as tightness of the chest and dyspnea</li>
            <li>Structural damage such as atria or aortic valve</li>
            <li>Walking and moving around using transportation</li>
            <li>Particular interpersonal interactions and relationships such as informal social relationships with friends and socializing for recreation and leisure</li>
            <li>Assistive devices and technology used for mobility, indoors and outdoors, and transportation</li>
            <li>Support systems from immediate families</li>
            <li>Health systems in place</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The care plan may be impacted by secondary and comorbid conditions.&#160; The clinician will need to identify and document relevant secondary and comorbid conditions, together with the above mentioned items to help establish hospice eligibility and to maintain a beneficiary-centered plan of care.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Secondary and Comorbid Conditions – The significance of a given comorbid condition is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments, together with any limitation in activity and restriction in participation, related to the comorbid condition.&#160; For example, a beneficiary with a primary or cardiopulmonary condition and ESRD could have specific ESRD-related impairments of water, mineral and electrolyte balance functions coexisting with the cardiopulmonary impairments associated with the primary cardiopulmonary condition (e.g., Aortic Stenosis, COPD or Heart Failure).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Ultimately, in order to support a hospice plan of care, the combined effects of the primary cardiopulmonary condition and any identified comorbid condition(s) should be such that most beneficiaries with the identified impairments would have a prognosis of six months or less.</p>
