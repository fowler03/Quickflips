        <h2 class="Heading2">Local Coverage Determinations</h2>
        <p>The Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) describe guidelines used by your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) in reviewing hospice claims to determine patient eligibility for hospice care.</p>
        <p>Some of the guidelines are general, others are disease-specific.&#160; Sometimes a patient has a life expectancy of six months or less, but doesn’t “fit” into the guidelines provided.&#160; In these cases, simply document the clinical facts that support a life expectancy of six months or less.</p>
        <p>If a patient improves or stabilizes to a point that no longer supports a prognosis of six months or less, the patient should be considered for discharge.&#160; However, some patients improve or stabilize and still have prognoses of six months or less.&#160; Those patients should remain under hospice care. </p>
        <p>A good question to ask at the time of recertification is, “If this patient were referred for admission today, would this patient meet hospice eligibility criteria?" or “We’ve observed this patient’s condition for 60 – 90 days, do we observe signs of disease progression or stability?”</p>
        <p>You have to identify and document the appropriate clinical information to demonstrate eligibility.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: The number one denial reason for hospice is the documentation submitted for review did not demonstrate the beneficiary being hospice appropriate.&#160; The MACs require the documentation of sufficient “clinical information and other documentation” to support the certification of individuals.&#160; The care plan may be impacted by relevant secondary and/or comorbid conditions.&#160; The significance of either is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments, together with any limitation in activity and restriction participation.&#160; Secondary conditions are directly related to a primary condition.&#160; In the case of ALS, examples could include dysphagia, pneumonia and pressure ulcers.&#160; Comorbid conditions are distinct from the terminal diagnosis itself, however, services aimed at the comorbid condition may relate to the palliation and/or management of terminal condition.&#160; An example of such comorbid condition for beneficiaries with ALS would be Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD.)</p>
