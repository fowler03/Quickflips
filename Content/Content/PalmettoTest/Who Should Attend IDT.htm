        <p>Who Should Attend IDT</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Required: MD, RN, social services, spiritual care services</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recommended:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Hospice aides – often have the most pertinent information about the patient’s condition, especially for recertification discussions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Admission nurses – so they can understand the rest of the care process (rotating)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Any other staff in contact with patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Role of MD in IDT</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Participate in the care discussions as appropriate – avoid using this time to “catch up on charting”</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Provide orders for care changes decided upon in the meeting</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Problem solve as a part of the team</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Listen to other team members to learn more about the patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Recertification Presentations by RN</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare ahead – be ready to present the patient’s pertinent data to support your belief that the patient should or should not be recertified</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use the last benefit period to frame your presentation – what has changed during the last benefit period?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Don’t present a snapshot of the patient’s current condition without comparison to their prior status</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suggested format: “The patient is an X year old man/woman with Y diagnosis who has declined in the past benefit period as evidenced by the following...”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For Manager Running The Meeting</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Solicit input from all disciplines on each patient</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">RN, MSW, MD, spiritual care, hospice aide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Evaluating and documenting eligibility for hospice care requires that you incorporate the eligibility guidelines into your thinking, team process and documentation.&#160;&#160; Here are some ideas for creating a “culture of eligibility.”</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Be sure you have a current copy of the LCD guidelines.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Refer to the guidelines before each visit, and before you write your assessments and visit notes.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Make available a copy to the IDT, and review one with your team at the beginning of every meeting, (“LCD of the Week”).</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use LCD-specific worksheets when documenting admissions and recertifications.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review the LCD guidelines for every admission and recertification before it is presented in IDT meeting.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In IDT meeting, rather than discuss patients by alphabet or by nurse, group them according to diagnosis, reviewing the LCD guideline before each group.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hang poster-size copies of the guidelines in your IDT room.&#160; Reference them.&#160; Quiz each other on them.&#160; Refer to them when reviewing patients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Suggested format for presenting a new admission at the IDT meeting:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Begin every presentation with “This is an X year old man/woman with the hospice diagnosis of Y...”</li>
            <li>Name, age, gender, diagnosis and attending physician</li>
            <li>Brief history of terminal illness and comorbidities</li>
            <li>Why now?&#160; What precipitated the referral to hospice?</li>
            <li>Problems, goals (including patient/family goals) and interventions identified at admission</li>
            <li>Disciplines and visit frequencies</li>
            <li>Any changes or additions to the Plan of Care since admission?</li>
            <li>Any unresolved issues, clinical or social, that need to be discussed by the team?</li>
            <li>Identify any missing information and assign a team member to obtain it</li>
            <li>Plan for next two weeks (until next IDT meeting or designated interval)</li>
            <li>Document the discussion and the plan (Plan of Care)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Suggested format:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Name, age, gender, diagnosis and attending physician</li>
            <li>State each of the problems on the Plan of Care and then either:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 43pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any changes in the past 2 weeks or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">“Well managed with current interventions” or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">“Resolved”</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="3">
            <li>Questions for the medical director or the team on any of these problems</li>
            <li>Were any new problems, goals or interventions added?&#160; Any new orders needed?&#160; Any change to visit frequencies?</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 through 4 for social work, spiritual care, volunteer and any other discipline involved</li>
            <li>Plan for next two weeks (until next IDT meeting or designated interval)</li>
            <li>Document the discussion and the plan (Plan of Care)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Think Differently:&#160; How about starting with the social worker or spiritual care counselor, or have team members take turns facilitating the meeting?</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Suggested format:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Name, place and date of death</li>
            <li>Identify any risks that might complicate effective grieving </li>
            <li>Initial Bereavement Plan of Care; who will be contacting who, and when?</li>
            <li>Can the team learn anything from this death; is there anything the team could have done better?</li>
            <li>Document the discussion and the plan</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some IDTs take a moment of silence or meditation after reviewing the deaths.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Factors that may interfere with effective grieving:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Family reluctant to face facts of illness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Assessment of eligibility should be continuous.&#160; The recertification evaluation should intensify at least two weeks before the actual recert date to allow time for close monitoring and assessment of the patient’s condition.&#160; Remember, ineligible patients should be discharged as soon as the team determines that they are ineligible; you should not wait until recert time.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Review the LCDs for the patient’s terminal diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Present a review of the patient’s disease progression since the last certification.&#160; Make comparisons to baseline data and data from previous points in time, to accurately demonstrate disease progression.</li>
            <li>Discuss symptomology in terms of the LCD.&#160; Does this patient have a life expectancy of six months or less?&#160; In addition to meeting the LCD criteria, patients should also have evidence of disease progression/decline in condition during the certification period.</li>
            <li>Document the discussion, the supporting evidence and the decision.</li>
            <li>If the team decides to recert:&#160; What is the plan moving forward?&#160; Are problems, goals and interventions appropriate for all disciplines? </li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 43pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Update the Plan of Care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain a recertification of terminal illness.&#160; The hospice medical director must include a brief narrative explanation of the clinical findings that supports a life expectancy of six months or less as part of the recertification.&#160; If the recertification is for the third benefit period or subsequent periods, a face-to-face encounter with the hospice physician or nurse practitioner is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="6">
            <li>If the patient is deemed no longer eligible, begin discharge planning and implement the two-day advance notification of the patient and family and advise them of their right to an expedited review of the hospice’s decision to discharge.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Nursing care may be covered on a continuous basis for as much as 24 hours a day during periods of crisis as necessary to maintain the patient at home.&#160; A period of crisis is a period in which the patient requires continuous care to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A dying patient is NOT a crisis, unless the symptoms are so severe that without continuous care the patient will need to be hospitalized.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">It may be useful to think of the continuous care criteria as being the same as inpatient criteria, except the goal is to prevent hospital admission.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Patients and families must understand that once the crisis is resolved and the patient is stabilized, continuous care will be discontinued.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Continuous care is meant to be for very brief periods of time, generally just a few days. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When continuous care is in place, it must be documented that the entire team is working with the patient and family to manage effectively without continuous care.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The documentation for starting and maintaining continuous care must reflect the crisis.&#160; The Plan of Care and notes must say, “Continuous care required due to___________, as evidenced by_________________.”&#160; “Dying process” or “end-of-life care” is not acceptable, without specifying the distressing symptoms that require constant care and/or monitoring.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice Aides, RNs and LPNs can be providers of continuous care, but an RN or LPN must provide at least 51% of the care in order to bill for at this level of care.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A minimum of 8 hours of care must be furnished to qualify for continuous care.&#160; However, the continuous care hours can be split into different shifts.&#160; Continuous care is billed on an hourly basis.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation should be hourly and describe:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 40pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Ongoing symptoms</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Symptom management</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Effectiveness of interventions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Continuous care is NOT:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For every dying patient</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Respite care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">An alternative to a nursing home</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">An alternative to private duty care for a patient who cannot be left alone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Access to general inpatient care (GIP) is made available to all hospice patients who are in need of pain control or symptom management that cannot be provided in any other setting.</p>
        <p>The inpatient stay is not intended to be custodial or residential.&#160; In fact, the COPs refer to this level of care as short-term inpatient care.&#160; Once the patient’s symptoms and pain are stabilized, he/she must return to the routine home care (RHC) level of care, even if he/she is still on the inpatient unit.</p>
        <p>Documentation must answer the question, “Why GIP?”&#160; (Instead of RHC), and, “What have you tried so far to fix this?”</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 22pt;" start="1">
            <li>Upon transfer to GIP level of care, documentation should include a precipitating event (onset of out of control symptoms), and the interventions tried in the home that have failed. </li>
            <li>During the inpatient stay, document daily why the patient still needs GIP.&#160; Examples:</li>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In April 2007, CMS issued a transmittal (1539) that clarified that GIP can not be used for caregiver breakdown, stating:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>…some hospices are billing Medicare for “caregiver breakdown” at the higher “general inpatient” level, rather than the lower payment for “inpatient respite” or “routine home care” levels of care. To receive payment for “general inpatient care” under the Medicare hospice benefit, beneficiaries must require an intensity of care directed towards pain control and symptom management that cannot be managed in any other setting.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This means that GIP must be related to symptoms as outlined above. Psychosocial crisis of the caregiver may result in use of respite care. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Respite care is short-term inpatient care provided to a patient to relieve the family members or other persons caring for the individual at home.&#160; Respite care may be provided only on an occasional basis and may not be reimbursed for more than five (5) consecutive days at a time.&#160; It’s alright for caregivers to take a trip, have an elective surgery or do anything they wish with their five days “off.”&#160; Respite care can also be used in cases of caregiver breakdown, as clarified by CMS in April 2007.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document respite care as a measure taken to provide a break for the caregivers.&#160; Hopefully the break will allow them to continue caring for the patient at home.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If due to caregiver breakdown, document the events leading to the respite care being provided.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Don’t forget to document your collaborative care planning and communication with facility staff.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Respite care may not be reimbursed for more than five (5) consecutive days at a time, including the date of admission but NOT including the date of discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the patient dies under inpatient respite care, the day of death is paid at the inpatient respite care rate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Inpatient respite care can only be provided in the following facilities:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">A Medicare-certified inpatient hospice facility</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">A Medicare-certified hospital or skilled nursing facility that has the capability to provide 24-hour nursing if the patient’s POC requires that type of nursing intervention</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note:&#160; Respite care cannot be provided for patients who reside in an assisted living facility or nursing home. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>An increasing number of patients residing in nursing homes* are benefiting from hospice care.</p>
        <p>A member of the interdisciplinary team will be designated for a patient residing in the facility to provide overall coordination of hospice care and communication with facility staff.&#160; This helps ensure quality of care for the patient and family.&#160; </p>
        <p>In addition to the documentation requirements and regulations for routine home care patients, the clinicians need to document that the following was delivered to the facility:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Most recent Plan of Care</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice election form and advance directives</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Physician certification and recertification of terminal illness</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Contact information for hospice personnel involved in hospice care of the patient</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Instructions on how to access hospice’s 24-hour on call system</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice medication information</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice physician or attending physician (if any) orders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the coordinated Plan of Care:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 40pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">What the nursing home staff is responsible for and what are hospice staff responsibilities</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Problems, patient goals, interventions and palliative outcomes on the hospice Plan of Care are consistent with the Plan of Care at the facility</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Medical orders, updates and changes made by the nursing home</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Coordination of care</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This type of documentation demonstrates that the hospice is maintaining professional case management of the patient’s care, communicating and collaborating with the nursing home.</p>
        <p>Documentation of shared care planning (attendance at care planning meetings in the facility, sharing the results of hospice IDT meetings, joint family meetings) also demonstrates collaboration.</p>
        <p>Any changes in the hospice plan of care must be discussed with the patient/representative and facility representatives and must be approved by the hospice before implementation.</p>
        <p>

                <p>*Nursing home is used to define SNF, NF, ICF or MR</p>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>Almost every home care patient should have evidence of disposition planning in his/her chart.&#160; Patients that decline may need placement, and patients that improve may no longer be eligible for hospice, and require discharge. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Absence of a plan, and the barriers to having a plan, must be documented along with the measures taken to address the barriers and find alternatives</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain written permission to release information about the patient before calling other facilities or services on their behalf.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Full report, including a discharge summary, must be made to the receiving team/facility upon discharge, revocation or transfer.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The family must be involved in the disposition or discharge plan.&#160; It is the social worker’s role to mobilize the strengths of the family system, not do everything for them.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Referrals or support groups for family members should be part of the discharge plan.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document all your discharge planning efforts, including names and phone numbers, so that someone else can pick up the trail in your absence.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document family participation and agreement, or the lack of such.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Plan recertification visits as early as possible if discharge is anticipated so that the family and patient will have sufficient time to prepare.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Patients discharged for ineligibility require at least two days advance notice of discharge, and you must advise them of their right to appeal the discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Final arrangements are also part of disposition planning.&#160; Do your best to document efforts to help families plan in advance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every GIP patient should have discharge planning (discharge back home or to facility) documented in the clinical record.&#160; Discharge planning should be documented daily.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discharge planning begins when the patient arrives at the inpatient unit, if not before.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">&#160;</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a family member refuses to take responsibility by participating in placement and discharge planning, it may constitute elder neglect.&#160; Involve your supervisor if family refuses to assist in disposition planning.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The typical preliminary plan is for the patient to return to the pre-inpatient location.&#160; Depending on the patient’s condition, this may not be an appropriate discharge option.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Other options include: home, ALF, a relative’s home, home with hired help, nursing home, transfer to relatives out of state, or self-pay at an inpatient unit.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Nursing home placement:&#160; If the patient does not have Medicaid, he/she will have to pay the room and board out-of-pocket.&#160; Patients admitted to a nursing home under the “rehab” or skilled Medicare benefit are not eligible for hospice care under Medicare until their rehab days are over, unless the hospice diagnosis is unrelated to the skilled nursing home diagnosis.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice physicians can help by anticipating the day of discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Nurses can help by identifying the medications, referrals and supplies that will be needed when the patient arrives at their next destination. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The acronym “SOAP” has been used for decades by health care professionals to help them remember the components of an excellent progress note.&#160; “S” = subjective:&#160; what the patient or family says they are experiencing.&#160; “O” = objective:&#160; the facts and data available.&#160; “A” = assessment:&#160; your professional evaluation.&#160; “P” = plan:&#160; the next best clinical intervention or step.&#160; </p>
        <p>The following examples may help you get the idea.</p>
        <p>S:&#160; Subjective</p>
        <p>Something the patient or caregiver has said that illustrates something of relevance about the clinical picture.&#160; </p>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">“How is he supposed to take these pills if he can’t swallow?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>O:&#160; Objective</p>
        <p>The facts and objective description.&#160; If a word like “anorexic” or “dyspneac” is used, follow it with evidence.&#160; Include quantitative data like weights, recumbent measurements, vital signs, labs (if available), Karnofsky, FAST or Palliative Performance Scale values, and make comparisons to previous time periods if possible.</p>

        <p>Answering these open-ended questions helps your notes provide depth and detail:</p>
        <p>WHY NOW?&#160; Anything new, such as an admission, a change in level of care, or a discharge, should identify a precipitant.&#160; What has changed? </p>
        <p>WHO SAYS?&#160; Is there supporting documentation from recent hospitalizations, attending physician notes, history and physicals, discharge summaries and labs?&#160; Get copies and include them.</p>
        <p>WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?&#160; Whatever it is, make sure there are problems, goals and interventions on the Plan of Care to address the change.</p>
        <p>HOW DO YOU KNOW?&#160; Describe what you see, read, hear, and smell that leads you to use the words you do.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For GIP patients, there are more questions that your notes must answer:</p>
        <p>WHY HERE?&#160; Your notes must describe symptoms and interventions that cannot be provided in another setting. That means, SNF, ALF or at home.</p>
        <p>WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR?  Document what has been tried so far to maintain the patient safely at home.</p>
