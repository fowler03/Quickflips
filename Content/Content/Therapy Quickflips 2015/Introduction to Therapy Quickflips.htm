        <h1 class="Heading1">Introduction to Therapy Quickflips <sup>©</sup></h1>
        <p>You are one of the lucky clinicians to be providing care in a truly holistic health care setting.&#160; Home health therapists get to know patients and their families in their own homes, providing the opportunity for trust and rapport that can lead to better care and support.&#160; Therapists align with patients in their territories, which can be one of the most effective ways to deliver health care.</p>
        <p>Therapy Quickflips<sup>©</sup> is written with the therapist in mind.&#160; In this guide, the therapist will find resources and guidance about regulations, best practice and documentation, all in a format that is easy to access in the field.</p>
        <p>The focus of Therapy Quickflips<sup>© </sup>is on the documentation of care that reflects the professional skills performed by physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists, while demonstrating compliance and eligibility under the regulations and guidelines published by Medicare.&#160; Other payors may have different requirements and it is important that you understand and follow those when caring for those patients.</p>
