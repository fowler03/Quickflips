                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Effective for episodes beginning on or after January 1, 2015, individual therapy disciplines to complete a reassessment at least every 30 days</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">30-day clock begins from the next day after the new assessment or reassessment (example: If assessment was on April 1, the count would begin April 2 and therapist will need to perform reassessment on or before May 1) </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A new 30-day calendar restarts with any reassessment visit performed </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">30-day reassessment is ongoing from therapist’s first visit and continues until discipline discharges and is not interrupted by certification periods</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For multiple rehab discipline cases, each discipline tracks their own 30-day reassessment clock </li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reassessments may be performed earlier than 30 days, but no grace period after 30 days</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reassessment visit should include:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">The actual provision of therapy intervention services by PT/OT/SLP (not assistant)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Functional assessment measuring progress to determine if goals have been met</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Documenting objective measurement results and corresponding therapy effectiveness</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The qualified therapist(s) (PT, OT, or SLP) completes the assessment/measurement and documentation requirements using standardized, objective measures whenever able. This allows for the comparison between the baseline and the reassessments for improvements.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assess and document the patient’s function, using a method which objectively measures activities of daily living such as, but not limited to, eating, swallowing, bathing, dressing, toileting, walking, climbing stairs, using assistive devices, and mental and cognitive factors.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Upon reassessment, document changes in the objective measurements and use these objective assessments in correlation with the impact on functionality in the home.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine if the goals of the plan of care have been achieved or if the plan of care requires updating. If needed, change therapy goals or obtain orders to update the plan of care.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If no progress is indicated, or no further skilled intervention is warranted, communicate with the physician regarding discharge from therapy services.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Provide either the ABN if discharging from therapy prior to expected in POC, but other disciplines are continuing, or provide the NOMNC if ending all care.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the measurement results do not reveal progress toward therapy goals and/or do not indicate that therapy is effective, but therapy continues, the qualified therapist(s) must document why the physician and therapist have determined therapy should be continued.</li>
