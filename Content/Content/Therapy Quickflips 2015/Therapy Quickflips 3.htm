        <h2 class="Heading2">Physician Orders</h2>
        <p>Physician orders must be received PRIOR to services being provided. “Verbal” orders can be documented by the therapist for the physician to countersign at a later date.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Physician Orders 1">Orders should answer the following questions:</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Physician Orders 1">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Who is to provide the service? (for example, skilled nurse, physical therapy, MSW, home health aide)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What is the type of service/ modality/ treatment ordered? (for example, evaluation, equipment/safety instruction, gait training, therapeutic exercise and HEP instruction for strengthening and balance)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">How often is the service provided, and for how long? (frequency and duration)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Physician Orders 2">Special reminders:</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Physician Orders 2">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Date and sign verbal orders – this shows the order was obtained before providing services.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If ranges are used, such as “1 to 2 times per week for 3 weeks,” the upper limit of the range is considered the specific frequency—your documentation should clarify visits below the higher frequency. Documentation of communication to the physician of missed visits is expected.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If “PRN” (“as needed”) orders are used, be sure to document a predetermined reason for that PRN visit, for example, “2 PRN nurse visits per month to assess any leaking of Foley catheter.”&#160; </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">There are no examples of PRN visits for therapy in the benefits manual. If awaiting equipment for training, you may consider a hold order until equipment arrives then obtain new orders for training needs.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Parameters for modalities used in therapy must be included in orders See Quickflip #15 Modalities for details.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Physicians must sign and date orders prior to the home health agency billing for that care. Some states and agencies also have established timeframes within which the order must be signed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Be sure your visits and visit notes match the frequency and duration of the orders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If visit frequency and duration needs to be increased or decreased, you must notify the physician and obtain new orders.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To add services from another discipline, you must obtain an order for at least the initial visit – and then that discipline must obtain subsequent orders for ongoing care.</li>
        </ul>
