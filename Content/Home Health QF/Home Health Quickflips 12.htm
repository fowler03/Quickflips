        </p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_25">Use standardized, objective tests and measures (e.g., measure strength deficits on 0-5 scale, measure Range of Motion deficits in degrees, measure balance with a standardized tool such as the Tinetti Test)</li>
            <li class="li_25">Describe therapeutic techniques such as neuromotor facilitation, passive joint mobilization, static sitting balance challenges, etc.</li>
            <li class="li_25">Emphasize teaching and training activities and the patient’s ability to follow through</li>
            <li class="li_25">Document progress in objective terms that demonstrate skills of the therapist:</li>

            <li class="li_7"><span class="span_17">Example:&#160; Instead of “ambulated 20 feet with walker and minimum assistance of 1”, state “Patient advances walker excessively and demonstrates step-to-gait pattern.&#160; Loss of balance x 1 on level r</span><span class="span_17">equiring PT to correct.&#160; Physical</span><span class="span_17"> facilitation and verbal cuing for step-through pattern and walker placement.&#160; Able to sustain correction x 20’ without loss of balance.”</span>

        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_25">Show a functional correlation to all therapeutic activities</li>
            <li class="li_25">Be specific regarding plan for next treatment/visit</li>
            <li class="li_27">Avoid documentation that reflects repetitive exercises and activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_21">Principle Two: </span><span class="span_21">Document why treatment is medically appropriate</span>
        </p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_26">Describe prior level of functional mobility and self-care</li>
            <li class="li_26">What event caused the change?</li>
            <li class="li_26">Describe the patient strengths that indicate potential to restore/improve function or safety</li>
            <li class="li_26">Goals should reflect a MATERIAL improvement in the patient’s ability to function more independently or more safely</li>
            <li class="li_26">Establish a home maintenance program and teach the patient or caregiver</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="Heading5">Principle Three: Treatment is dependent on patient's condition</h5>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">Document any other conditions that may support need for therapy in situations that would</span><span class="span_17"> not</span><span class="span_17"> ordinarily need a therapist.</span>
