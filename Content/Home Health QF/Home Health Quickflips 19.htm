        <p class="p_8">&#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText_5">Progress notes and the discharge summary can paint a picture of the patient and the outcomes of home health care.&#160; Some agencies use progress notes routinely, while others utilize visit notes as progress notes, accompanied by 60-day summaries.&#160; Adhere to your agency policy.</p>
        <p class="BodyText_1">A progress note should answer three questions:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_11">
            <li class="li_26">What was the patient’s prior clinical and functional status?</li>
            <li class="li_26">What is the patient’s current clinical and functional status?</li>
            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">What is the anticipated clinical and functional p</span><span class="span_17">icture</span><span class="span_17">?&#160; </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_13">
            <li class="ListParagraph_2">Are there changes in the Plan of Care?&#160; </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_2">What is the rehab potential and progress toward goals?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText_1">Upon discharge:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_26">Ensure that all disciplines have discharged the patient from service in a timely fashion.&#160; </li>
            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">When writing the discharge summary, include everything that is addressed in a progress note, </span><span class="span_17">plus </span><span class="span_17">the reason for discharge and any additional services the patient will have after discharge from home health.&#160; </span>
            </li>
            <li class="li_26">Notify the patient’s physician of discharge per agency policy.&#160; For example, send discharge summary or physician order as notification.</li>
        </ul>
