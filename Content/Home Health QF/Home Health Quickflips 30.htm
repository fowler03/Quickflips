        <p class="BodyText_3"><span class="span_6">This M item assesses pain that interferes with </span><span class="span_6">the</span><span class="span_6"> patient’s activity, and how frequent it is.&#160; The clinician should consider item response using information the day of assessment and recent pertinent past. Some hints when assessing this are:</span>

        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">Identify pain that interferes with activity – this may not mean that the patient cannot do the activity, it may just interfere to the </span><span class="span_17">extent </span><span class="span_17">that the patient </span><span class="span_17">chooses not to perform activity as frequently as desired, has to adapt his or her normal ways of performing activity</span><span class="span_17">, or causes the activity to take longer to complete.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_8">
            <li class="li_7"><span class="span_17">Change in frequency of an activity or how the activity is performed is considered </span><span class="span_33">interference</span><span class="span_17">.&#160; When responding to M1242, it must be assessed how often this activity is occurring with the interference, or how often the patient would have performed this activity if it weren’t for the interference of the pain.&#160; This is the answer for M1242.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">Ask if patient limits him or herself from any “normal activity,” such as climbing stairs</span><span class="span_17"> – if patient chooses to limit due to pain, it is interfering</span><span class="span_17">.</span>

            <li class="li_11"><span class="span_17">Use assessment as well as interview;</span><span class="span_17"> note</span><span class="span_17"> facial expressions, grimaces</span><span class="span_17">, etc.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li_31"><span class="span_17">Assess if pain medications are effective – if medications are effective, the pain might not be interfering</span><span class="span_17"> with activity or movement.</span>

        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_17">Pain intensity is best assessed using a standardized</span><span class="span_17">, validated</span><span class="span_17"> assessment tool (i.e. one with a precise rating scale.)&#160; The tool should be appropriate to the patient’s ability to respond.&#160; Additional pain assessment may include:</span>
