        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Four Principals of Skilled Nursing</h2>
        <p class="BodyText_6">&#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText_6"><span class="span_6">There are</span><span class="span_6"> four principles </span><span class="span_6">to use w</span><span class="span_6">hen making a determination if </span><span class="span_6">skilled </span><span class="span_6">nursing s</span><span class="span_6">ervices are covered by Medicare</span><span class="span_6">.&#160; Review th</span><span class="span_6">ese principles at start of care</span><span class="span_6"> and throughout the episode of care.&#160; Recertification is an important milestone to thoroughly reassess if the patient is </span><span class="span_6">still eligible under</span><span class="span_6"> Medicare.&#160; All of the principles should be considered when making this determination, and Principle Four must be met in all circumstances.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText_6">&#160;</p>
        <h5 class="Heading5">Principle One: Requires the skills of a nurse</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="span_17">This</span><span class="span_17"> principle is the most straight</span><span class="span_17">forward.&#160; Ask yourself, “Do the services I am providing require the special training of a nurse?”</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Provision of specific services, such as: injections, catheter changes, complex wound care, o</span><span class="span_17">bservation and </span><span class="span_17">assessment, or </span><span class="span_17">teaching</span><span class="span_17">.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Please see your state’s Nurse Practice Act for skills that an RN </span><span class="span_17">must perform </span><span class="span_17">and </span><span class="span_17">those that </span><span class="span_17">LVN/LPN can perform under the supervision of an RN</span><span class="span_17">.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Remember, meeting this principle alone does not </span><span class="span_17">indicate</span><span class="span_17"> Medicare coverage.&#160; </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="Heading5">Principle Two: Service is not skilled just because it’s performed by a nurse</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_17">As part of a visit</span><span class="span_17">, the nurse will perform clinical tests or procedures that a patient, family member or home health aide could perform.&#160; These services </span><span class="span_17">alone </span><span class="span_17">would not constitute a skilled visit by themselves</span><span class="span_17"> – skilled services must also be performed during the visit</span><span class="span_17">.&#160; </span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Examples of </span><span class="span_17">“non-skilled”</span><span class="span_17"> services include: g</span><span class="span_17">lucometer checks, simple wound care</span><span class="span_17">, </span><span class="span_17">blood</span><span class="span_17"> pressure</span><span class="span_17"> check</span><span class="span_17">.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">The patient or caregiver’s</span><span class="span_17"> inability to perform these tasks do</span><span class="span_17">es not change the fact that the</span><span class="span_17"> service is not skilled.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <h5 class="Heading5"><span class="span_21">Principl</span><span class="span_21">e Three: Service does not become unskilled because it has been taught</span>
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_17">Caregivers</span> <span class="span_17">can be</span><span class="span_17"> taught</span><span class="span_17"> skilled procedures in the home, such as:</span><span class="span_17"> complex wound care, injections,</span><span class="span_17"> IVs,</span><span class="span_17"> etc. </span><span class="span_17"> These services remain “skilled”, even if a caregiver is performing them.</span></li>
            <li><span class="span_17">I</span><span class="span_17">f </span><span class="span_17">the care</span><span class="span_17">giver becomes </span><span class="span_17">unwilling or unavailable </span><span class="span_17">to provide the services, these services remain skilled and a </span><span class="span_17">nurse can still perform</span><span class="span_17"> the services as needed.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h5 class="Heading5">Principle Four: Reasonable and necessary</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_17">Patient condition warrants the care</span><span class="span_17">.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Non-skilled services could require the skills of a nurse based on the patient’s medical condition, e.g. c</span><span class="span_17">leansing a superficial wound and applying topical ointment would not necessarily r</span><span class="span_17">equire the skills of a nurse.&#160; But, i</span><span class="span_17">f this uncomplicated wound is on the foot of a diabetic patient, skilled nursing may be reasonable and medically necessary.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="span_17">Medical necessity must be evident in documentation</span><span class="span_17">.&#160; Be sure to include:</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_13">Objective terms regarding service performed</li>
            <li class="li_13"><span class="span_17">Description of patient condition, including </span><span class="span_17">comorbidities</span><span class="span_17"> that affect care</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li_13">Patient’s response (or lack thereof) to treatment</li>
            <li class="li_13">Changes in condition</li>
