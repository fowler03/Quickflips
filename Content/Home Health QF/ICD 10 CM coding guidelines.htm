        <p>ICD-10-CM coding guidelines<span class="span_17"> state that certain </span><span class="span_17">Z</span><span class="span_17">-cod</span><span class="span_17">e</span><span class="span_17">s need a numeric secondary diagnosis code in </span><span class="span_17">M1023</span><span class="span_17"> to describe a resolving condition or sequelae.&#160; PPS points for many of these diagnoses will be awarded based simply on their placement in </span><span class="span_17">M1023</span><span class="span_17">.</span><span class="span_17">No case mix points are awarded based on codes entered into M1025.</span></p>

        <p class="p_42">Manifestation Codes</p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_17">Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology.&#160; In such conditions, the ICD-10-CM has a coding convention that requires the underlying condition to be sequenced first followed by the manifestation code, even when the manifestation</span><span class="span_17"> is a greater focus of care than the underlying condition.</span><span class="span_17">&#160; The ICD-</span><span class="span_17">10</span><span class="span_17">-CM manual clearly shows when the manifestation codes apply, and the underlying cause diagnosis, or </span><span class="span_18">etiology </span><span class="span_17">must be included</span><span class="span_17"> immediately before the manifestation diagnosis.&#160; </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_17">A good example of this situation is category F02 - Dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.&#160; A list of common underlying conditions (etiologies) is listed for this diagnosis of dementia in diseases classified elsewhere.&#160; For example, dementia in Parkinson’s Disease.&#160; In the Alphabetic Index, the code for Parkinson’s Disease (G20) is listed first, followed by code F02.80 or F02.81 in brackets.&#160; G20, Parkinson’s Disease, represents the underlying etiology and must be coded first, with F02.80 or F02.81 sequenced second t</span><span class="span_17">o represent the manifestation of</span><span class="span_17"> dementia with or without behavioral disturbance.</span>
        </p>
        <p>ICD-10-CM has combined some etiology/manifestation odes into combination codes so the clinician only has to code the one combination code rather than two or more codes.&#160; This can be seen with Diabetes, a diagnosis with more potential manifestations than any other single diagnoses.</p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_17">T</span><span class="span_17">he ICD-</span><span class="span_17">10</span><span class="span_17">-CM manual gives direction to first code the underlying diagnosis</span><span class="span_17"> when an etiology/mani</span><span class="span_17">festation situation exists and there is</span><span class="span_17"> no combination code available.</span>
