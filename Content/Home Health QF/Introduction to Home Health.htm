        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_17">You are one of the lucky clinicians to be providing care in a truly holistic health care setting.&#160; Home health clinicians get to know patients and their families in their own homes, providing the opportunity for trust and rapport that can lead to better care and support.&#160; We align with</span><span class="span_17"> patients in their territories</span><span class="span_17">, which can be one of the most effective ways to deliver health care.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText_5">In this setting, the clinician functions independently and autonomously.&#160; This is our strength, though some clinicians report feeling as if they were on an “island,” without the support of colleagues while in the home.&#160; There are also many requirements for paperwork and documentation.&#160; </p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_22">Home Health Quickflips</span><sup class="sup_6">©</sup><span class="span_17"> is written with the clinician in mind.&#160; In this guide, the clinician will find resources and guidance about regulations, best practice and documentation, all in a format that is easy to access in the field.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span_17">The focus of </span><span class="span_22">Home Health Quickflips</span><sup class="sup_6">© </sup><span class="span_17">is on the documentation of care that reflects the professional skills performed by home health clinicians, while demonstrating compliance and eligibility under the regulations and guidelines published by Medicare.&#160; Other payors may have different requirements and it is important that you understand and follow those when caring for those patients.</span>
