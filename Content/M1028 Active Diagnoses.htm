        <h2 class="Heading2_1">M1028: Active Diagnoses - Comorbidities and Co-Existing Conditions</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This “M” item identifies whether two specific diagnoses are present, and active.  These diagnoses influence a patient’s functional outcomes or increase a patient’s risk for development or worsening of pressure ulcer(s).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)</li>
            <li>Diabetes Mellitus (DM)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To check either of these there must be a direct relationship to the patient’s current medical treatments, nurse monitoring, functional, cognitive, mood, or behavior status or risk of death at the time of the assessment.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Consider only diagnoses confirmed and documented by the physician.  Reflect what is known at the time of the assessment.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A dash (-) value is a valid response for this item.  A dash value indicates that no information is available and/or the item could not be assessed.</p>
