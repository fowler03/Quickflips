            <MadCap:keyword term="Local Coverage Determinations" />Local Coverage Determinations</h2>
        <p><span class="span_6">The </span><span class="span_6">Local Coverage Determinations (</span><span class="span_6"><MadCap:keyword term="LCD" /><MadCap:glossaryTerm>LCD</MadCap:glossaryTerm>s</span><span class="span_6">)</span><span class="span_6"> describe guidelines used by your <MadCap:keyword term="Medicare Administrative Contractor" /><MadCap:keyword term="Medicare" />Medicare </span><span class="span_6">Administrative Contractor</span> <span class="span_6">(</span><span class="span_6"><MadCap:keyword term="MAC" /><MadCap:glossaryTerm>MAC</MadCap:glossaryTerm></span><span class="span_6">) </span><span class="span_6">in reviewing hospice claims to determine patient <MadCap:keyword term="eligibility" />eligibility for hospice care.</span></p>
        <p class="p_8">Some of the guidelines are general, others are disease-specific.&#160; Sometimes a patient has a <MadCap:keyword term="life expectancy" />life expectancy of six months or less, but doesn’t “fit” into the guidelines provided. In these cases, simply <MadCap:keyword term="document" />document the <MadCap:keyword term="clinical" />clinical facts that support a life expectancy of six months or less.</p>
        <p class="p_8">If a patient improves or stabilizes to a point that no longer supports a <MadCap:keyword term="prognosis" />prognosis of six months or less, the patient should be considered for discharge.&#160; However, some patients improve or stabilize and still have <MadCap:keyword term="prognoses" />prognoses of six months or less.&#160; Those patients should remain under hospice care. </p>
        <p class="p_8">A good question to ask at the time of <MadCap:keyword term="recertification" />recertification is, “If this patient were referred for <MadCap:keyword term="admission" />admission today, would this patient meet hospice eligibility <MadCap:keyword term="criteria" />criteria?" or “We’ve observed this patient’s condition for 60 – 90 days, do we observe signs of disease progression or stability?”</p>
        <p>How can you tell if the patient still meets the eligibility criteria? </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">The patient will meet the LCD guidelines for “<span class="span_1">General Decline in Clinical Status</span>” (Part I).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_1">OR</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_5">The patient will meet the LCD “<span class="span_1">Non-Disease Specific Baseline” </span><span class="span_1">(Part II) </span>guidelines <span class="span_1">and</span> the “<span class="span_1">Disease Specific” </span>guidelines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have to identify and document the appropriate criteria.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: The number one denial reason for hospice is the <MadCap:keyword term="documentation" />documentation submitted for review did not demonstrate the <MadCap:keyword term="beneficiary" />beneficiary being hospice appropriate.&#160; The MACs require the documentation of sufficient “clinical information and other documentation” to support the certification of individuals.&#160; The care plan may be impacted by relevant <MadCap:keyword term="secondary" />secondary and/or <MadCap:keyword term="comorbid" />comorbid conditions.&#160; The significance of either is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments, together with any limitation in activity and restriction participation.&#160; Secondary conditions are directly related to a <MadCap:keyword term="primary" />primary condition.&#160; In the case of <MadCap:keyword term="ALS" /><MadCap:glossaryTerm>ALS</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, examples could include <MadCap:keyword term="dysphagia" />dysphagia, <MadCap:keyword term="pneumonia" />pneumonia and <MadCap:keyword term="pressure ulcers" />pressure ulcers.&#160; Comorbid conditions are distinct from the <MadCap:keyword term="terminal diagnosis" />terminal diagnosis itself, however, services aimed at the comorbid condition may relate to the palliation and/or management of the terminal condition.&#160; An example of such comorbid condition for beneficiaries with ALS would be <MadCap:keyword term="Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" />Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease <MadCap:keyword term="COPD" />(<MadCap:glossaryTerm>COPD</MadCap:glossaryTerm>.)</p>
