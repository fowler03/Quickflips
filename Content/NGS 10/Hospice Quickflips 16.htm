                    <li class="li_1">Patients are assessed by each discipline.&#160; Problems, goals and interventions are identified (based on the patient’s/family’s needs and goals).&#160; This group of individualized problems/goals/interventions is collectively called the Plan of Care (POC).</li>
                    <li class="li_1">Based on the POC, each discipline provides care/service to the patient/family.&#160; That means that each visit should be focused on a problem identified on the POC, and reflect professional intervention(s) to achieve the desired goal.</li>
                    <li class="li_1">Document the patient’s progress toward meeting the desired goal(s) in the POC after each visit.&#160; The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) summarizes the effectiveness of interventions and plans for the next two weeks on the IDT summary form.&#160; Every visit note and IDT note should reflect attention to the problems/goals/interventions.</li>
                    <li class="li_1">If you are seeing a patient, and the focus of the visit is not on one of the problems identified in the POC, ask “Am I focused on a new problem?”&#160; If so, add it to the POC!&#160; If you are not focused on a new or existing problem, ask “Is there a need for me to visit?”</li>
                    <li class="li_1">If you are seeing a patient and none of the problems on the POC requires you or the patient’s attention, ask yourself, “Are these problems resolved?”&#160; If so, document the resolution.</li>
                    <li class="li_1">If there are consistently no problems that you and the patient/family can work to resolve together, ask yourself “Am I seeing this patient too frequently?&#160; Does this patient require intervention from my discipline at this time?”&#160; If you are a case manager, ask “Is this patient still eligible for hospice care?”</li>
