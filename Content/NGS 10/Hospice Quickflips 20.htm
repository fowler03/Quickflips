        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">“Tell me about what you hope for in the coming days/weeks/months.” </li>
            <li class="li_1">“Are there things you have left to do?”</li>
            <li class="li_1">“What are some of your worries about the future?”</li>
            <li class="li_1">“What are some of the problems facing you now?”</li>
            <li class="li_1">“What are some of the things you wish you could talk about?”</li>
            <li class="li_1">“If you could be granted a wish (other than a physical cure) what would it be?”</li>
            <li class="li_1">“Are there things your family needs help with?”</li>
            <li class="li_2">“How can I help you the most?”</li>
