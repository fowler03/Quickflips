        <h2 class="Heading2">Discharge and Disposition Planning</h2>
        <p>Almost every home care patient should have evidence of disposition planning in his/her chart.&#160; <MadCap:toggler targets="Discharge and Disposition Planning 1">Patients that decline may need placement, and patients that improve may no longer be eligible for hospice, and require discharge. </MadCap:toggler></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Discharge and Disposition Planning 1">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Absence of a plan, and the barriers to having a plan, must be documented along with the measures taken to address the barriers and find alternatives</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain written permission to release information about the patient before calling other facilities or services on their behalf.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Full report, including a discharge summary, must be made to the receiving team/facility upon discharge, revocation or transfer.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The family must be involved in the disposition or discharge plan.&#160; It is the social worker’s role to mobilize the strengths of the family system, not do everything for them.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Referrals or support groups for family members should be part of the discharge plan.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document all your discharge planning efforts, including names and phone numbers, so that someone else can pick up the trail in your absence.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document family participation and agreement, or the lack of such.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Plan recertification visits as early as possible if discharge is anticipated so that the family and patient will have sufficient time to prepare.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Patients discharged for ineligibility require at least two days advance notice of discharge, and you must advise them of their right to appeal the discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Final arrangements are also part of disposition planning.&#160; Do your best to document efforts to help families plan in advance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:toggler targets="Discharge and Disposition Planning 2">Every GIP patient should have discharge planning (discharge back home or to facility) documented in the clinical record.&#160; Discharge planning should be documented daily.</MadCap:toggler>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 22pt;" MadCap:targetName="Discharge and Disposition Planning 2">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discharge planning begins when the patient arrives at the inpatient unit, if not before.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a family member refuses to take responsibility by participating in placement and discharge planning, it may constitute elder neglect.&#160; Involve your supervisor if family refuses to assist in disposition planning.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The typical preliminary plan is for the patient to return to the pre-inpatient location.&#160; Depending on the patient’s condition, this may not be an appropriate discharge option.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Other options include: home, ALF, a relative’s home, home with hired help, nursing home, transfer to relatives out of state, or self-pay at an inpatient unit.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Nursing home placement:&#160; If the patient does not have Medicaid, he/she will have to pay the room and board out-of-pocket.&#160; Patients admitted to a nursing home under the “rehab” or skilled Medicare benefit are not eligible for hospice care under Medicare until their rehab days are over, unless the hospice diagnosis is unrelated to the skilled nursing home diagnosis.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Hospice physicians can help by anticipating the day of discharge.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Nurses can help by identifying the medications, referrals and supplies that will be needed when the patient arrives at their next destination. </li>
        </ul>
