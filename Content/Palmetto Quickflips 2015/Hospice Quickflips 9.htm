        <h2 class="Heading2">Failure to Thrive</h2>
        <p>The adult failure to thrive syndrome is characterized by unexplained weight loss, malnutrition and disability.&#160; The syndrome has been associated with multiple primary conditions (e.g., infections and malignancies), but always includes two defining clinical elements:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Nutrition impairment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AND</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Disability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The nutritional impairment and disability associated with the adult failure to thrive syndrome may manifest as an irreversible progression in the patient’s nutritional impairment/disability despite a trial of therapy (i.e., treatment intended to affect the primary condition responsible for the patient’s clinical presentation).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The presence of comorbid conditions may hasten the patient’s clinical progression and as such should be identified and addressed.</p>
        <p>This hospice policy addresses those cases where reversible causes of severe nutritional impairment and disability (i.e., the adult failure to thrive syndrome) have been excluded.</p>

                    <li>The nutritional impairment associated with the adult failure to thrive syndrome should be severe enough to impact on a beneficiary’s weight.&#160; It is expected that the Body Mass Index (BMI) of beneficiaries electing the Medicare Hospice Benefit for the adult failure to thrive syndrome will be below 22 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and that the patient is either declining enteral/parenteral nutritional support or has not responded to such nutritional support, despite an adequate caloric intake.</li>
