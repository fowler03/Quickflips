        <h2 class="Heading2">Eligibility for Medicare</h2>
        <p>Medicare has rules about the services it pays for. For a patient to be eligible for home health, he or she must meet the following criteria, at the start of care and throughout each 60-day episode of care:</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Under Care of Physician means:</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 1">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The physician must establish Plan of Care (POC).</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The case manager collaborates with the physician to develop the POC.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Direction and signature must be from the physician, not a physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The physician must review the POC at least every 60 days.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All disciplines caring for the patient must have orders from the physician for the care they are providing.</li>
                </ul>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Confined to the Home or “Homebound.” Two criteria need to be met:</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 2">Criteria One: The patient must either:</p>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 3">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Because of illness or injury, need the aid of supportive devices such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs and walkers; the use of special transportation; or the assistance of another person in order to leave their home</li>
                </ul>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 4">OR</p>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 5">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Have a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated</li>
                </ul>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 6">If the patient meets one of the “Criteria One” conditions, then the patient must ALSO meet two additional requirements defined in “Criteria Two”:</p>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 7">Criteria Two:</p>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 8">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">There must exist a normal inability to leave home;</li>
                </ul>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 9">AND</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;" MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 10">Leaving home must require a considerable and taxing effort</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Exceptions to the “homebound” rule are:Medical care absences, adult day care, second home, religious services, infrequent absences and special occasions.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p>When documenting homebound status, be objective, use measurable terms and avoid repetitive or vague documentation.</p>
                <p>Example: Patient unable to leave home without assist due to recent hospitalization for PNA and currently with decreased strength and mobility requiring min A on stairs to exit home, ambulation requires a FWW and close SBA with patient demonstrating SOB with RR of 32 after 50 feet requiring sitting rest. Pt. has not been able to resume community activities since returning home.</p>

                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;" MadCap:targetName="Eligibity for Medicare 11">One or more of the following must be provided based on patient condition, needs and medical necessity: skilled nursing, physical therapy, speech-language pathology and continued occupational therapy services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 12">Note: OT cannot be a qualifying skill at start of care.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;" MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 13">Skilled care is assessment, observation, teaching and treatment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: General wellness and health without patient specific illness or injury is not covered under Medicare Part A for therapy (for example “home safety check” without a patient condition of debility, weakness or gait and balance deficit).</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Services are Medically Necessary for the Patient means:</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 14">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The home health care services provided must be necessary for the patient’s recovery or health in the home.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Medical necessity is based on the individual patient’s condition.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p>When documenting medical necessity, show the skilled service and the reason this skilled service is necessary using objective terms.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 15">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Gait training 75’x2 on carpeted surfaces from living room to bedroom requiring min A for balance and weight shifting and cues for safe progression of FWW.

                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Passive range of motion (ROM) to left upper extremity 10 reps each of shoulder flexion, abduction and horizontal abd/add within pain tolerance of less than 4/10.

                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p>Demonstrate the medical necessity of skilled observation and assessment by documenting the complexity of the patient’s condition and comorbidities that may affect the outcomes of the condition you are assessing.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul MadCap:targetName="Eligibility for Medicare 16">
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Patient requires Mod A for bed mobility and does not demonstrate enough motor control to roll or weight shift in bed without assistance and therefore at risk of skin breakdown and respiratory complications.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">ADL training needed in functional balance during toileting hygiene and Lower body clothes management due to fear of falling and min A needed to maintain balance with base of support at 4 inches apart.</li>
