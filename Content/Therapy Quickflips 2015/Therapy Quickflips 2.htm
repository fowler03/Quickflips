        <p>The Plan of Care (POC) is an overview of the patient’s medical condition and a roadmap of interventions to get to his or her goals. The POC is developed in a collaborative effort between the patient, the clinician and the patient’s physician. Your agency may use a form called a “CMS 485” for the POC. This form had previously been required by Medicare, but now is an optional form. The information required for the POC remains mandatory.</p>

        <p>Expand the POC into a road map for the patient’s care by including details of services each discipline will perform, and objective, patient-oriented goals.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Review your POC to ensure that the patient’s assessment of problems (impairments) matches the planned interventions (treatments), goals (indicators, outcomes) and orders for treatment.</p>
