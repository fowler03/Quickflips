        <h2 class="Heading2">Home Health Aide Supervision and Care Plan</h2>
        <p>Certified Home Health Aide (CHHA) services are considered a “dependent service,” and can only be provided under Medicare when there continues to be a skilled service (for example, skilled nurse or therapist) involved in the patient’s care. The supervising nurse or therapist is responsible for writing a CHHA Plan of Care (POC) and providing supervisory visits to ensure the plan is being carried out safely.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The CHHA POC may look a lot like a checklist of tasks to be performed.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Develop the CHHA POC based on your assessment of the patient’s needs. These tasks include personal care services, such as:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="ul_1">
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">General hygiene and grooming</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Bathing and shampooing</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Assistance with dressing (including application of support hose)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Simple meal preparation and other incidental housekeeping</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CHHAs can also be instructed to perform other simple skills as an extension of the nurse or therapist, and after being tested for competency to complete the assigned tasks. These tasks could include: </li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="ul_1">
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Simple wound care and assistance in administering medications that are ordinarily self-administered</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Toileting and elimination</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Routine range of motion or exercises</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Routine ambulation and transfers</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Vital signs or glucometer checks</li>
                </ul>

        <p>Note: Each state has guidelines on the scope of these skills.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When assigning a CHHA to a patient, assess the skill set of the CHHA and the needs of the patient to ensure a good match.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Update or review CHHA POCs at least every 60 days, and as needed due to patient needs or condition changes. Communicate these changes to the patient and the CHHA providing the care.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CHHA services are ordered by the physician as part of the plan of care and provided on an intermittent basis where there is not a capable and willing caregiver.</li>
        </ul>

                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The CHHA needs to document:</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Activities completed according to the POC</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">The CHHA does not need to be present</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">Much of this supervision role can be completed by interviewing the patient</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">If patient is receiving nursing care, the nurse must perform the supervisory visit</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">If patient is receiving therapy only, then supervision is completed by the appropriate therapist</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Regardless of whether nursing is case manager, therapists involved with patient’s care should assist in ensuring CHHA is aware and trained to patient’s most current functional ability relating to personal care (for example, from bed bath to transfer to shower for bathing)</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For patients that only have supportive services in the home, perform a supervisory visit at least every 60 days</li>

                <ul class="ul_1">
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">This visit must be provided at the time of the CHHA’s visit</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: square;">An actual assessment of the patient care while it is being provided by the CHHA must be completed</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Remember to document your supervisory visits to include:</li>
