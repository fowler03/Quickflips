                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Under the consolidated payment system for Home Health, concurrent Home Health rehab and outpatient rehab services from outside clinics or hospitals are allowed.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Be aware that the agency is responsible for the payment to the contracting outpatient service and to make contract arrangements for services to meet all Home Health criteria, POC and documentation requirements. The agency will then bill Medicare for the services.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If no contractual arrangements were made, the agency is not obligated to pay and the outpatient service cannot bill Medicare.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">These outpatient services should be limited to interventions that are not available from the agency (for example, barium swallow, lymphedema management) while the patient is still considered homebound.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehab programs are excluded from the consolidated billing provisions for Home Health.</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When Part A services are completed and patient no longer meets homebound status criteria, agencies may also provide Part B outpatient services directly or under contract to complete any medically needed skilled care.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Agencies must meet all Outpatient Medicare Benefit Coverage Criteria rules for billing and payment per Benefits Policy Manual Chapter 15 and any other related billing and payment policies (Therapy Cap amount adjusts annually).</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Therapy must meet all the Functional limitation G-codes, CPT code requirements and Medicare documentation requirements for outpatient rehab services.</li>
